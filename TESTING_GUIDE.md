# Testing Guide for Food Search Feature

## ‚úÖ **Issue Fixed Successfully!**

The `FoodSearchResult` export error has been resolved by creating a centralized types file.

## üß™ **How to Test the Food Search Feature**

### 1. **Access the Application**
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173/`
- Navigate to the "Add Meal" page

### 2. **Test Indian Food Search**
Try searching for these Indian foods that are now in the local database:

- **"idli"** - Should show "Idli (2 pieces)" with low health risk
- **"dosa"** - Should show "Dosa (1 medium)" with nutritional info
- **"dal"** - Should show "Dal (100g)" with protein content
- **"roti"** - Should show "Roti/Chapati (1 piece)"
- **"paneer"** - Should show "Paneer (100g)" with medium health risk
- **"samosa"** - Should show "Samosa (1 piece)" with high health risk warning

### 3. **Test USDA API Integration**
Try searching for these foods to test the USDA API:

- **"chicken"** - Should show multiple chicken options from USDA
- **"salmon"** - Should show fish options with nutritional data
- **"rice"** - Should show both local and USDA rice varieties
- **"apple"** - Should show various apple types from USDA

### 4. **Test Autocomplete Features**

#### **Keyboard Navigation:**
1. Type "ch" in the search box
2. Use ‚Üì arrow key to navigate down through results
3. Use ‚Üë arrow key to navigate up
4. Press Enter to select highlighted item
5. Press Escape to close dropdown

#### **Mouse Interaction:**
1. Type any food name
2. Click on any result to select it
3. Click outside the dropdown to close it

### 5. **Test Health Risk Indicators**
Look for color-coded health risk badges:

- **üü¢ Green**: Low risk foods (vegetables, fruits, lean proteins)
- **üü° Yellow**: Medium risk foods (some meats, dairy)
- **üî¥ Red**: High risk foods (fried foods, processed items)

### 6. **Test Environmental Impact Display**
Each food should show:
- **CO‚ÇÇ emissions** (kg CO‚ÇÇ)
- **Water usage** (Liters)
- **Source indicator** (Local or USDA badge)

### 7. **Test Search Performance**
- **Debouncing**: Type quickly - search should wait 300ms after you stop typing
- **Loading indicator**: Should see spinning icon during API calls
- **Caching**: Search for the same term twice - second search should be faster

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Successful Search Results Should Show:**
1. **Food name** with proper formatting
2. **Category** (e.g., "Indian Breakfast", "Meat", "Vegetables")
3. **Environmental metrics** (CO‚ÇÇ, water usage)
4. **Health risk badge** (if applicable)
5. **Source badge** ("USDA" for API results)
6. **Nutritional info** (calories, protein) when available

### **Error Handling:**
- **No results**: Should show "No foods found for [query]"
- **Short queries**: No search until 2+ characters
- **API errors**: Should fallback gracefully to local database

## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **If Search Doesn't Work:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify internet connection (for USDA API)
3. Try searching for local foods first ("idli", "dal")

### **If Dropdown Doesn't Appear:**
1. Make sure you typed at least 2 characters
2. Check if results are found (try "chicken")
3. Click in the search box to focus

### **If Health Indicators Missing:**
1. Some USDA foods may not have health risk data
2. Local foods should always show health indicators

## üìä **Performance Metrics**

### **Expected Response Times:**
- **Local search**: < 50ms
- **USDA API search**: 200-1000ms (depending on network)
- **Cached results**: < 10ms

### **Search Accuracy:**
- **Local foods**: 100% accuracy for exact matches
- **USDA foods**: Depends on API data quality
- **Fuzzy matching**: Partial word matching supported

## üéâ **Success Criteria**

‚úÖ **Search works for "idli"** - Shows Indian food with proper data  
‚úÖ **Autocomplete dropdown appears** - Shows results as you type  
‚úÖ **Keyboard navigation works** - Arrow keys and Enter function  
‚úÖ **Health risk indicators display** - Color-coded badges appear  
‚úÖ **Environmental data shows** - CO‚ÇÇ and water usage visible  
‚úÖ **USDA integration works** - External foods appear with "USDA" badge  
‚úÖ **No console errors** - Application runs without JavaScript errors  

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

After successful testing, you can:
1. **Get a real USDA API key** (replace DEMO_KEY in foodApiService.ts)
2. **Add more Indian foods** to the local database
3. **Customize health risk calculations** based on your requirements
4. **Add more food categories** and environmental data

The food search feature is now fully functional and ready for use!
